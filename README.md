### Description
This is a small Web application that retrieves the MLB salary data from https://questionnaire-148920.appspot.com/swe/data.html and uses it to find a Qualifying Offer. The data is retrieved via web scraping, and the application is powered by Node.js and Express.js. The visualization component is done using the D3.js library. All referenced code and resources are cited within my code.
